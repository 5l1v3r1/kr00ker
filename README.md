kr00ker
============


# Description 
This script is a simple experiment to exploit the KR00K vulnerability (CVE-2019-15126), 
that allows to decrypt some WPA2 CCMP data in vulnerable devices (Access Point or Clients).
More specifically this script attempts to retrieve Plaintext Data of WPA2 CCMP packets knowning:
 * the TK (128 bites all zero) 
 * the Nonce (sent plaintext in packet header)
 * the Encrypted Data

 Where:
 * WPA2 AES-CCMP decryption --> AES(Nonce,TK) XOR Encrypted Data = Decrypted Data  
 * Decrypted stream starts with "\xaa\xaa\x03\x00\x00\x00"
 * Nonce (104 bits) = Priority (1byte) + SRC MAC (6bytes) + PN (6bytes)

# Limitations
To check the Kr00k vulnerability it coulb be necessary to launch the PoC multiple times, because (it seems that) not always
a sufficient amount of data is buffered on vulnerable devices (hint: try using streaming apps).

# Notes
This script must be run as privileged user and with wireless interface configured in monoitor mode


# Dependencies
The installation of the Python packages "scapy" and "Cryptodome" is required.
The script is compatible with Python 3.



# Usage
Following are reported some usage examples of the tool. 
Use the "--help" option for a more exhaustive list.


Launch the Kr00k attack against the client (-t client) device:
```
# python3 kr00ker.py -i <interface-name> -s <SSID> -c <MAC-client> -n <num-packets> -r <reason-id> -t client -w <wifi-channel> -d <delay>
```
or launch the Kr00k attack against the Access Point (-t ap) device:
```
$ sudo python3 kr00ker.py -i <interface-name> -s <SSID> -c <MAC-client> -n <num-packets> -r <reason-id> -t ap -w <wifi-channel> -d <delay>
```
